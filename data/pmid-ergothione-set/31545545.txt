Sulfoxide synthases are non-heme iron enzymes that participate in the biosynthesis of thiohistidines, such as ergothioneine and ovothiol A. The sulfoxide synthase EgtB from Chloracidobacterium thermophilum (CthEgtB) catalyzes oxidative coupling between the side chains of N-α-trimethyl histidine (TMH) and cysteine (Cys) in a reaction that entails complete reduction of molecular oxygen, carbon-sulfur (C-S) and sulfur-oxygen (S-O) bond formation as well as carbon-hydrogen (C-H) bond cleavage. In this report, we show that CthEgtB and other bacterial sulfoxide synthases cannot efficiently accept selenocysteine (SeCys) as a substrate in place of cysteine. In contrast, the sulfoxide synthase from the filamentous fungus Chaetomium thermophilum (CthEgt1) catalyzes C-S and C-Se bond formation at almost equal efficiency. We discuss evidence suggesting that this functional difference between bacterial and fungal sulfoxide synthases emerges from different modes of oxygen activation.
