Ozone, the main component of photochemical smog and air pollution, can damage the skin by oxidizing stratum corneum enzymes, lipids and structural proteins. We have developed a rapid screening assay to determine free radical scavenging capacity of various active ingredients that are frequently used in personal care products. Several known antioxidants including vitamin C, vitamin E analog Trolox, walnut seed extract, lipoic acid and ergothioneine inner salt were assayed for their ability to neutralize ozone-induced oxidation of beta-phycoerythrin, a fluorescent reporter protein derived from algae. The free radical scavenging capacities of these antioxidants were quantified and compared. The results demonstrate that this assay is a valuable primary screening tool for identifying antioxidant activity of natural or synthetic substrates that can be used in personal care products to protect the uppermost layer of our skin from oxidizing damage induced by O3.
