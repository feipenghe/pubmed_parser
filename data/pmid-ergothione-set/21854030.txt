Aerosol glucocorticoid medications have become more and more important in treating BA (bronchial asthma). Although these agents are dosed to directly target airway inflammation, adrenocortical suppression and other systematic effects are still seen. To tackle this problem in a novel way, two L-carnitine ester derivatives of prednisolone (as the model drug), namely, PDC and PDSC, were synthesized to increase the absorption of prednisolone across the human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells by the organic cation/carnitine transporter OCTN2 (SLC22A5) and then to slowly and intracellularly release prednisolone. The transport of prednisolone, PDC and PDSC into the human bronchial epithelial BEAS-2B cells was in the order PDSC > prednisolone > PDC at 37 °C. It was found that PDSC displayed 1.79-fold increase of uptake compared to prednisolone. Transport of PDSC by BEAS-2B was temperature-, time-, and Na(+)-dependent and saturable, with an apparent K(m) value of 329.74 μM, suggesting the involvement of carrier-mediated uptake. An RT-PCR study showed that organic cation/carnitine transporters OCTN1 and OCTN2 are expressed in BEAS-2B cells, but little in HEK293T cells. The order of uptake by HEK293T was prednisolone > PDC > PDSC. In addition, the inhibitory effects of organic cations such as L-carnitine, ergothioneine, TEA(+) and ipratropium on PDSC uptake in BEAS-2B cells were in the order L-carnitine > ipratropium > TEA(+) > ergothioneine, whereas their inhibitory effects on PDSC uptake in HEK293T cells were negligible. Finally, in vitro LPS-induced IL-6 production from BEAS-2B was more and longer suppressed by PDSC than prednisolone and PDC. All of these results suggested PDSC may be an attractive candidate for asthma treatment.
