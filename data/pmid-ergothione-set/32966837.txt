Owing to the prevalence of chronic inflammation and its related disorders, there is a demand for novel therapeutic agents capable of preventing or suppressing inflammation. Natural products (NPs) are well established as an important resource for drug development and provide an almost infinite array of molecular entities. Sulfur-containing NPs (i.e., NPs containing one or more sulfur atoms) are abundant throughout nature, from bacteria to animals. The aim of this review was to survey the emerging evidence on role of sulfur-containing NPs, such as glutathione, garlic-derived sulfur compounds, Epipolythiodioxopiperazines (EPTs), Isothiocyanates (ITCs), and Ergothioneine (EGT), in the control of inflammation and to determine the possible underlying mechanisms. A discussion of how hydrogen sulfide (H2S), an endogenous gaseous signaling molecule, links sulfur-containing NPs and their anti-inflammatory action is also performed. This review may help to further the development of sulfur-based compounds by providing a guide for structure-activity relationship-based modification for use in modern medicinal chemistry. However, as this field is still in its infancy, the review is concluded by an overview of the progression of these promising entities as therapeutic agents.
