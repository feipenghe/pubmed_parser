A simple and rapid method for the determination of nanomole levels of biological thiols is described. The analysis is based on the combination of reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography with a postcolumn reaction with 6,6'-dithiodinicotinic acid. Thiols, including cysteine, cysteamine, thiolhistidine, homocysteine, glutathione, penicillamine, ergothioneine, and thiouracil were separated by eluting with 33 mM KH2PO4 at pH 2.2. Glutathione, cysteine, cysteamine, homocysteine, and penicillamine were quantitatively determined with detection limits of 0.1 nmol, while the quantitative detection of thiolhistidine, ergothioneine, and thiouracil was not successful. The method was applied to the assay of glutathione in human erythrocytes and Escherichia coli.
