The human organic cation/ergothioneine transporter 1 (hOCTN1, gene symbol SLC22A4) is responsible for the cellular uptake of substances, such as L-ergothioneine, which is an important antioxidant in mammalian cells. The common-function-altered variant L503F-hOCTN1 has been associated with susceptibility to Crohn's disease in certain populations. Previously, we identified eight novel nonsynonymous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in the SLC22A4 gene in the Chinese and Indian populations of Singapore. The present study evaluated the impact of these novel SNPs on hOCTN1 transport function in HEK-293 cells. Transport uptake assays with L-ergothioneine were used to assess the function of the variant transporters. Cell surface biotinylation and Western blot analysis were used to characterize cellular transporter expression. Comparative modeling was used to locate amino acid substitutions in the topology of hOCTN1 in order to account for altered transport function. Transporter activity was markedly impaired in four of the naturally occurring hOCTN1 variants (R63H, R83P, G482D, and I500N). Multiple glycosylated isoforms of hOCTN1 proteins were identified in the plasma membrane and in the whole cell. Either the total cellular or membrane expression of the functionally deficient transporter variants was lower than that of the wild-type hOCTN1. The underlying mechanism involves both impaired transporter-substrate binding affinity and turnover rate. Considered together, several naturally occurring SNPs in the SLC22A4 gene encode variant hOCTN1 transporters that may impact the cellular uptake of L-ergothioneine and other substrates, with the potential to influence the antioxidant capacity of human cells.
