Edible mushrooms are classified as a functional food. The study aimed to initiate in vitro cultures of selected species of Pleurotus: P. citrinopileatus, P. djamor, P. eryngii, P. florida, P. ostreatus, and P. pulmonarius and to optimize the method of cultivation of these species to obtain raw materials characterized by pro-health properties. Another objective was to analyze the biologically active substances in the obtained mushroom materials. By determining the organic compounds and bioelements present in the species selected for the study, it was found that the fruiting bodies obtained by cultivation were characterized by a high content of phenolic and indole compounds. Similarly, the mycelia obtained from in vitro culture were found to contain significant amounts of organic compounds exhibiting biological effects such as lovastatin. The study revealed that the composition of biologically active substances varied between the mycelia obtained from in vitro cultures and the fruiting bodies obtained by cultivation.
