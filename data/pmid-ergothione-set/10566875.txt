The natural antioxidant ergothioneine (EGT) was tested for its ability to inhibit cell death caused by hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and to inhibit DNA oxidation by peroxynitrite (ONOO-) in human neuronal hybridoma cell line (N-18-RE-105). High concentrations of EGT (5 mM) were tolerated by the N-18-RE-105 cells. N-acetylcysteine (NAC) was not well tolerated by the cells at concentrations greater than 3 mM (cell viability averaged 50%). Increasing concentrations of EGT increases cell viability in the presence of NAC. EGT at concentrations up to 2 mM weakly improved cell viability in the presence of H2O2. NAC at concentrations up to 2 mM weakly decreased, but not significantly, the viability of the cells. At a higher concentration of 5 mM, NAC weakly protected the neuronal cells against the H2O2-induced cell death. The protection was significantly enhanced by preincubation with EGT. Ergothioneine inhibited ONOO(-)-induced oxidative damage in isolated calf thymus DNA and DNA in N-18-RE-105 cells. The concentration of EGT in human and mammalian tissue has been estimated to be 1-2 mM, which suggests that EGT may serve as a non-toxic thiol buffering antioxidant in vivo and may find applications in pharmaceutical preparations where oxidative stability is desired.
