Ergothioneine is a biologically important compound that has been shown to be transported by the organic cation transporter novel type 1 (OCTN1). Following this discovery, a variety of alternate functions for OCTN1 have been suggested including an integral function in the extra-neuronal cholinergic system. The present study reaffirms the primacy of ergothioneine over these alternate substrates using natively expressed OCTN1 in HeLa cells. Besides the general transport inhibitors, quinidine, verapamil and pyrilamine no other putative substrate inhibited ergothioneine transport significantly, with only a slight inhibition demonstrated by carnitine. Even compounds structurally similar to ergothioneine failed to inhibit ergothioneine uptake, suggesting high selectivity of OCTN1. Ergothioneine was found to be avidly accumulated even at low concentrations (300â€¯nM) by HeLa cells.
