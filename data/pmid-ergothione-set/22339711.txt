Pleurotus eryngii (DC. : Fr.) Ouel. was used in solid-state fermentation to develop novel mushroom products with a high amount of ergothioneine. The correlation coefficients between ergothioneine content and biomass were 0.8878 and 0.9206 for fermented adlay and buckwheat, respectively. Using optimal conditions, Pleurotus-fermented adlay and buckwheat (PFA and PFB) with the ergothioneine contents of 795.5 and 786.1 mg/ kg, respectively, were prepared. However, mycelia contained the highest ergothioneine content of 1514.6 mg/kg. As a result of SSF by P. eryngii, PFA and PFB contained more taste components than adlay and buckwheat, as evidenced by higher contents of total sugars and polyols, total free amino acids and monosodium glutamate-like components, and total and flavor 5'-nucleotides. In addition, PFB and buckwheat showed comparable equivalent umami concentration (EUC) values, whereas PFA showed a higher EUC value than adlay. Overall, Pleurotus-fermented products with a high amount of ergothioneine will be a novel functional food.
