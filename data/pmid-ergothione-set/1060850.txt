The use of an 'open' artificial vagina made it possible to separate the individual jets in the ejaculate of the stallion. A total of 132 jets were collected in this way from twenty-one ejaculates. After macro- and microscopic examination and sperm counting, glycerylphosphorylcholine (GPC), ergothioneine and fructose levels were determined for every jet. The values obtained for the first three jets were similar and accounted for about 76% of all spermatozoa, and 70% of GPC. These jets also contained the highest concentration of ergothioneine and fructose.
