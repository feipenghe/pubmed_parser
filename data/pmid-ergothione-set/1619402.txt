The interaction of gold(I) thiomalate (Autm) (Myocrysine) with ergothionine (ErSH) has been studied in aqueous solution at pH 7.4. It was found that ErSH forms a ternary complex of the type ErS-Au-tm at a 1:1 mole ratio; unlike other thiols (e.g., cysteine and glutathione) it does not eject thiomalate (Htm) as a free ligand. However, in the presence of glutathione (GtSH), both ligands, ErSH as well as Htm, from the ErS-Au-tm complex were freed. The 13C NMR chemical shifts of C-2 resonance of ergothionine in the presence of Autm shifts greater than imidazolidine-2-thione (Imt) and 1,3-Diazinane-2-thione (Diaz), indicating the stronger complexation of ErS-Au-tm compared to Imt-Au-tm and Diaz-Au-tm.
