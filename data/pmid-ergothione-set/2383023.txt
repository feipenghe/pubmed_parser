In this paper, we demonstrate that ergothioneine (ES), a naturally occurring thiolhistidine, reduces ferrylmyoglobin (MbIV) to MbIII when the former (ferryl species) is produced by exposing either deoxy MbII or MbIII to H2O2. The reduction of MbIV to MbIII by ES yields the disulfide of ES which the addition of GSH promptly reduces back to ES. The addition of ES (100 microM) in the perfusion buffer of Langendorff rat heart preparations exposed to a brief period of ischemia prevents the myocardial damage (lactate dehydrogenase release) which accompanies reperfusion. The results of these experiments support a view that ES and its redox couple GSH might function in a Mb redox cycle.
