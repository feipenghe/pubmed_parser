Because of the high incidence of and high mortality rates associated with cancer, effective therapy for cancer is currently an imperative issue. Taiwanofungus salmoneus, a medicinal mushroom indigenous to Taiwan, has been demonstrated to exhibit various physiological activities and harmless effects. The bioactive compounds and anticancer abilities of T. salmoneus mycelia and fermented products were evaluated in this study. Total phenols, flavonoids, and ergothioneine were detected in mycelia and fermented products, and the amount of ergothioneine was evaluated in buckwheat (56.25-118.64 μg/g extract) and oats (53.60-138.70 μg/g extract) after fermentation. Results showed that T. salmoneus-fermented buckwheat and oats exhibited better apoptotic effects on Sk-Hep-1 and Caco-2 cells than sorafenib and celecoxib via receptor-linked apoptosis and mitochondria-mediated apoptosis. In addition, T. salmoneus-fermented buckwheat may have potential for replacing anticancer drugs or for consumption as a dietary supplement to retard cancer development.
