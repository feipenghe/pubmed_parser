To study the chemical constituents of Tylopilus plumbeoviolaceus. The compounds were isolated by silica gel column chromatography, and their structures were elucidated by spectral methods. Five compounds were isolated and identified as ergosterol (I), ergosterol 5a,8a-peroside (II), ergothioneine (III), adenosine (IV), uracil (V). All these compounds are obtained from this high fungus for the first time.
