Ergothioneine is a sulfur metabolite that occurs in microorganisms, fungi, plants, and animals. The physiological function of ergothioneine is not clear. In recent years broad scientific consensus has formed around the idea that cellular ergothioneine primarily protects against reactive oxygen species. Herein we provide evidence that this focus on oxygen chemistry may be too narrow. We describe two enzymes from the strictly anaerobic green sulfur bacterium Chlorobium limicola that mediate oxygen-independent biosynthesis of ergothioneine. This anoxic origin suggests that ergothioneine is also important for oxygen-independent life. Furthermore, one of the discovered ergothioneine biosynthetic enzymes provides the first example of a rhodanese-like enzyme that transfers sulfur to non-activated carbon.
