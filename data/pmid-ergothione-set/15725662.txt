A new ergothioneine derivative named beta-hydroxyergothioneine was isolated from the mushroom Lyophyllum connatum. Ergothioneine,N-hydroxy-N',N'-dimethylurea, and connatin (N-hydroxy-N',N'-dimethylcitrulline) were also isolated. All the compounds displayed the ability to scavenge free radicals, based on a 1,1-diphenyl-2-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. Structural determination, including the absolute stereochemistry of beta-hydroxyergothioneine, was achieved by spectroscopic analysis and X-ray crystallography. The radical scavenging activity of beta-hydroxyergothioneine was almost the same as that of ergothioneine. beta-Hydroxyergothioneine showed the greatest protective activity against carbon tetrachloride-induced injury in primary culture hepatocytes.
