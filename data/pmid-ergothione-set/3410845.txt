Ellman's reagent was used to induce an oxidative stimulus on the exofacial membrane sulfhydryl groups of the human erythrocyte. Thiol-disulfide exchange occurring extracellularly was monitored using resonance Raman spectroscopy, and intracellular changes were observed by 1H spin echo nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy of the intact cell. The stimulus caused oxidation and depletion of the glutathione pool, which was followed at higher concentrations of Ellman's reagent by a depletion of intracellular ergothioneine levels. Larger changes are induced intracellularly than would be expected from the stoichiometry of the reaction at the exofacial surface. A mechanism is proposed which links exofacial sulfhydryl receptor sites via the transport proteins to spectrin and glutathione. The consequences for the cellular redox balance of an extracellular stimulus of this type are discussed.
