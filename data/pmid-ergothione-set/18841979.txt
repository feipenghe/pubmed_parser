The antioxidative property of a hydrophilic extract prepared from the fruiting body of edible mushroom ( Flammulina velutipes) was evaluated. The mushroom extract contained ergothioneine (ERT) at a level of 3.03 +/- 0.07 mg/mL, showed higher 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging activity, and suppressed lipid oxidation of bigeye tuna meat more effectively than authentic L-ERT added at the same concentration. The authentic L-ERT had stronger total reducing power than the mushroom extract and inhibited the formation of metmyoglobin (metMb) more significantly in bigeye tuna meat. Lipid oxidation in beef and fish meats to which the mushroom extract had been added was "virtually" controlled during storage on ice. Ground beef and bigeye tuna meat with the extract added kept their natural colors unchanged for longer than 12 and 7 days of ice storage, respectively. Contrary to this, browning in meat color was observed in the control samples without the extract after 6 and 2 days of storage, respectively, when stored under similar conditions. There was significant correlation between meat color and chemical parameters, including total lipid hydroperoxides, thiobarbituric acid reactive substances, and metMb. However, there was no significant correlation between pH value and meat discoloration. These results suggest that ERT in the hydrophilic extract of F. velutipes plays an important role as a color stabilizer of meats.
