Ergothioneine, a novel imidazole sulfhydryl/thione compound formed in millimolar amounts by fungi, is a potentially important defense against electrophiles and free radicals. Protection may well occur both in organisms that synthesize ergothioneine and in animals including man that ingest and store ergothioneine in red blood cells, the liver, seminal fluid, and central nervous system. Ergothioneine blocks the mutagenicity for Salmonella strain TA1950 (hisG46 uvrB) of the nitrosation products of spermidine to an extent that is approximately proportional to the ergothioneine concentration. Ergothioneine also alleviates mutagenicity of cumene and t-butyl hydroperoxides but does not react with N-methyl-N'nitro-N-nitrosoguanidine as does the cysteinyl sulfhydryl compound, glutathione.
