Trehalose, a naturally occurring non-reducing disaccharide, is known to act as a major protein stabilizer that can reduce ultraviolet B (UVB)-induced corneal damage when topically applied to the eye. However, due to the low skin permeability of trehalose, which makes the development of topical formulations difficult, its use as a skin photoprotective agent has been limited. Previous findings demonstrated that liposomes may significantly improve the intracellular delivery of trehalose. Therefore, the present study aimed to assess the protective effects of trehalose-loaded liposomes against UVB-induced photodamage using the immortalized human keratinocyte cell line, HaCaT. The effects were also compared to those of the common skin photoprotective compounds, including L-carnosine, L-(+)-ergothioneine, L-ascorbic acid and DL-Î±-tocopherol. The levels of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers, 8-hydroxy-2'-deoxyguanosine and protein carbonylation in HaCaT cells were used as biological markers of UVB-induced damage. Compared to other compounds, trehalose-loaded liposomes showed the highest efficacy in reducing the levels of the three markers following UVB irradiation of HaCaT cells (all P<0.001 when compared to each of the four other photoprotective compounds). Therefore, these findings indicate that there may be a clinical application for trehalose-loaded liposomes, and further studies should be performed to assess the potential usefulness in skin photoprotection and the prevention of non-melanoma skin cancer.
