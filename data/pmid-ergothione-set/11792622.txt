We hypothesized that metallothionein (MT), a cysteine-rich protein with a strong affinity for Zn(2+), plays a role in nitric oxide (NO) signaling events via sequestration or release of Zn(2+) by the unique thiolate clusters of the protein. Exposing mouse lung fibroblasts (MLF) to the NO donor S-nitrosocysteine resulted in 20-30% increases in fluorescence of the Zn(2+)-specific fluorophore Zinquin that were rapidly reversed by the Zn(2+) chelator N,N,N',N'-tetrakis-(2-pyridylmethyl)ethylenediamine. The absence of a NO-mediated increase in labile Zn(2+) in MLF from MT knockouts and its restoration after MT complementation by adenoviral gene transfer inferred a critical role for MT in the regulation of Zn(2+) homeostasis by NO. Additional data obtained in sheep pulmonary artery endothelial cells suggested a role for the apo form of MT, thionein (T), as a Zn(2+)-binding protein in intact cells, as overexpression of MT caused inhibition of NO-induced changes in labile Zn(2+) that were reversed by Zn(2+) supplementation. Furthermore, fluorescence-resonance energy-transfer data showed that overexpression of green fluorescent protein-modified MT prevented NO-induced conformational changes, which are indicative of Zn(2+) release from thiolate clusters. This effect was restored by Zn(2+) supplementation. Collectively, these data show that MT mediates NO-induced changes in intracellular Zn(2+) and suggest that the ratio of MT to T can regulate Zn(2+) homeostasis in response to nitrosative stress.
