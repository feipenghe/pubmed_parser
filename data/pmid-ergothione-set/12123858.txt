Injection of the glutamate agonist N-methyl-D-aspartate into the vitreous body of the rat eye resulted in a number of morphological changes in the retina. Most apparent was a dramatic reduction in the density and sizes of neurons accompanied by a decrease in amyloid precursor protein and glial fibrillary acidic protein immunoreactivity. Cell counts revealed that 81% of ganglion cells and 43% of non-ganglion cells were lost as a result of the treatment. However, in animals treated with the antioxidant ergothioneine, these figures dropped to 44 and 31%, respectively. Thus, ergothioneine appears to be neuroprotective in this system and the data suggest that antioxidants may provide a useful means of modulating glutamate-based toxicity.
