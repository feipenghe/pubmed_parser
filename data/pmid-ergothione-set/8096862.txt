The following topically-applied thiols were investigated with regard to their possible UV-radiation protective properties: captopril, cysteamine, ergothioneine, mesna, mercaptopropionylglycine, N-acetyl-cysteine and penicillamine. As a measure for protection the inhibition of in vivo irreversible photobinding of the labelled phototoxic drugs chlorpromazine (CPZ) and 8-methoxypsoralen (8-MOP) to rat epidermal biomacromolecules was used. Ergothioneine, mesna and penicillamine did not show any effect; probably, as a result of their charge they are not able to enter the stratum corneum. Captopril, cysteamine, mercaptopropionylglycine and N-acetylcysteine showed a considerable inhibition of CPZ and 8-MOP photobinding. Captopril and N-acetylcysteine were clearly the most potent whereas cysteamine was the least effective. Captopril, mercaptopropionylglycine and N-acetylcysteine appeared to have a wider action range and to be a more effective protector than dl-alpha-tocopherol and di-butyl-hydroxytoluene. Cysteamine and mercaptopropionylglycine were only capable of protecting the stratum corneum. Captopril and N-acetylcysteine on the other hand showed an additional dose-dependent inhibition of photobinding to the viable epidermis. Gradually with increasing time after application, the protecting efficacy with regard to the viable layer of the epidermis decreased; the duration of protection depending on the dose.
