One of the major causes of Alzheimer's disease (AD) is oxidative stress, which accelerates β-amyloid peptide (AP) plaque and neurofibrillary tangle accumulation in the brain. Pleurotus eryngii is known to be rich in antioxidants, including ergothioneine, adenosine, and polyphenol, which can reduce oxidative stress-related aging. The aim of this study was to investigate the proximate and functional composition of P. eryngii, and evaluate the cognitive effects of low (LPE), medium (MPE), and high (HPE) P. eryngii dosages in an Aβ-induced Alzheimer's disease C57BL/6J mouse model. Mice fed P. eryngii for six weeks showed no adverse effects on body weight gain, food intake efficiency, serum biochemical parameters, and liver and kidney histopathological features. The relative brain weight was significantly lower in Aβ-injected mice (p < 0.05). Further, P. eryngii was shown to delay brain atrophy. Reference memory behavioral tasks showed that LPE, MPE, and HPE significantly decreased escape latency (49-85%) and distance (53-69%, p < 0.05). Probe and T-maze tasks showed that P. eryngii potently ameliorated memory deficit in mice. An AD pathology index analysis showed that P. eryngii significantly decreased levels of brain phosphorylated τ-protein, Aβ plaque deposition, malondialdehyde, and protein carbonyl (p < 0.05). P. eryngii may therefore promote memory and learning capacity in an Aβ-induced AD mouse model.
