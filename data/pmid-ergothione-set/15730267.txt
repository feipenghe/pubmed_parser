The presence of thiols in living systems is critical for the maintenance of cellular redox potentials and protein thiol-disulfide ratios, as well as for the protection of cells from reactive oxygen species. In addition to the well-studied tripeptide glutathione (gamma-Glu-Cys-Gly), a number of compounds have been identified that contribute to these essential cellular roles. This review provides a survey of the chemistry and biochemistry of several critically important and naturally occurring intracellular thiols such as coenzyme M, trypanothione, mycothiol, ergothioneine, and the ovothiols. Coenzyme M is a key thiol required for methane production in methogenic bacteria. Trypanothione and mycothiol are very important to the biochemistry of a number of human pathogens, and the enzymes utilizing these thiols have been recognized as important novel drug targets. Ergothioneine, although synthesized by fungi and the Actinomycetales bacteria, is present at significant physiological levels in humans and may contribute to single electron redox reactions in cells. The ovothiols appear to function as important modulators of reactive oxygen toxicity and appear to serve as small molecule mimics of glutathione peroxidase, a key enzyme in the detoxification of reactive oxygen species.
