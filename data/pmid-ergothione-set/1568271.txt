The ability of thiols, 2-imidazolethiones and uric acid to protect bovine oxyhemoglobin from copper(II)-induced oxidation to methemoglobin was investigated. The oxidation of oxyhemoglobin by Cu(II) proceeded in two phases: (1) an initial rapid reaction (less than 30 s) followed by (2) a slower reaction that carried it to completion. Thiols, including N-acetyl-L-cysteine, DL-dithiothreitol, reduced glutathione, DL-homocysteine, 2-mercaptoethanol and 2- and 3-mercaptopropionic acid, whose sulfhydryl groups were slowly oxidized by Cu(II) (with the exception of 2-mercaptopropionic acid), protected oxyhemoglobin in both phases of the reaction. Other thiols, including L-cysteine, cysteamine, and D-penicillamine, whose sulfhydryl groups were readily oxidized by Cu(II), protected hemoglobin initially, but within 2-4 min, the rate of methemoglobin formation was the same as Cu(II)-treated oxyhemoglobin. 2-Mercaptoimidazole and 1-methyl-2-mercaptoimidazole, which complex Cu(II) and inhibit Cu(II)-catalyzed oxidation of ascorbic acid, also protected hemoglobin in the initial phase, but not in the second phase. Uric acid, L-ergothioneine, and thiourea did not protect oxyhemoglobin in either the fast or slow phase. Cu(II) may have a coordination site involved in the oxidation of hemoglobin that is not blocked by the 2-imidazolethiones, uric acid, or the oxidized thiols. It is concluded that certain thiols that complex Cu(II) and are not rapidly oxidized will protect oxyhemoglobin from Cu(II)-induced oxidation, but the thiols are no longer effective once they are oxidized.
