Treatment of oxidative stress-related pathologies is a possible therapeutical strategy for the future. Natural product with antioxidant properties could trigger this goal. The aim of this in vitro study was to assess the antioxidant activity of the natural product ergothioneine (EGT), a compound of plant origin, which is assimilated and conserved by mammals in erythrocytes, kidney, seminal fluid and liver. We measured the antioxidant activity of EGT as its ability to antagonize the oxidation of alpha-keto-gamma-methiolbutyric acid (KMBA) by hydroxyl radical, peroxyl radicals and peroxynitrite. The results are expressed as total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC) units. Glutathione (GSH), uric acid and 6-hydroxy-2,5,7,8-tetramethylchroman-2-carboxylic acid (trolox), the water-soluble analog of vitamin E, were used as the reference antioxidants. EGT was the most active scavenger of free radicals as compared to classic antioxidants as GSH, uric acid and trolox. In particular, the highest antioxidant capacity exhibited by EGT vs. peroxyl radicals (5.53 +/- 1.27 units) resulted 25% higher than the value obtained with the reference antioxidant trolox (4.4 +/- 0.6 units, P < 0.01). The scavenging capacity of EGT towards hydroxyl radicals (0.34 +/- 0.09 units) was 60% higher, as compared to uric acid (0.21 +/- 0.04 units, P < 0.001), which represent the reference antioxidant vs. hydroxyl radicals. Finally, EGT showed the highest antioxidant activity also towards peroxynitrite (5.2 +/- 1.0 units), with a scavenging capacity 10% higher than that of uric acid (4.7 +/- 0.9 units, P < 0.05). This study showed that EGT has potent intrinsic anti-hydroxyl, anti-peroxyl and anti-peroxynitrite radicals antioxidant activity, as compared to classic molecules with antioxidant capacity as GSH, trolox and uric acid. This appears of interest, given the increasing use of non-vitamins cocktails for therapeutical approaches to many oxidative-induced pathologies.
