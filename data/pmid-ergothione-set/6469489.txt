Cataract in the developing chick embryo can be easily produced by administration of high doses of glucocorticoid and the cataract is preceded by a decreased level of glutathione in the lens (Nishigori et al, Exp Eye Res 36:617, 1983). In an attempt to prevent cataract formation, various natural and synthetic sulfhydryl compounds, glutathione, cysteine, ergothioneine, penicillamine, cysteamine and N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine, were applied to hydrocortisone-treated developing chick embryos. N-(2-mercaptopropionyl)glycine showed the most potent delaying activity against cataract formation and also lessened the decrease of glutathione level in the lens. However, except for cysteamine, the other compounds tested had little or no effect.
