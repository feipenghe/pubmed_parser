Sulfoxide synthases are enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of small sulfur-containing natural products. Their enzymatic activity represents a unique sulfur transfer strategy in nature that is the insertion of a sulfur atom on the imidazole ring of histidine. To date, only two enzymes are known to carry out this function: the sulfoxide synthase EgtB, involved in the biosynthesis of ergothioneine in fungi and bacteria, and the 5-histidylcysteine sulfoxide synthase OvoA, involved in the biosynthesis of ovothiols, found in the eggs and biological fluids of marine invertebrates, some proteobacteria and protists. In particular, ovothiols, thanks to their unique redox properties, are probably the most intriguing marine sulfur-containing molecules. Although they have long been considered as cellular protective molecules, new evidence suggest that their biological activities and ecological role might be more complex than originally thought. Here, we investigate the evolutionary history of OvoA in Metazoa, reporting its monophyletic ancient origins, which could be traced back to the latest common ancestor of Choanozoa. Nevertheless, we show that OvoA is missing in several major extant taxa and we discuss this patchy distribution in the light of the massive genome reduction events documented in Metazoa. We also highlight two interesting cases of secondary acquisition through horizontal gene transfer, which occurred in hydrozoans and bdelloid rotifers. The evolutionary success of this metabolic pathway is probably ascribable to its role in the maintenance of cellular redox homeostasis, which enables organisms to survive in different environmental niches.
