The binding of mercuric ion (Hg(II)) by small molecules in the intracellular region of intact human erythrocytes has been studied by 1H-NMR spectroscopy. HgCl2 added to intact erythrocytes in saline-glucose suspension is found to cross the membrane and reach an equilibrium distribution among the molecules of the erythrocyte within 4 min. In the intracellular region Hg(II) reacts with GSH and hemoglobin to form the ternary mixed-ligand complex GSH-Hg(II)-hemoglobin. The analogous complex with ergothioneine is formed after all the GSH is complexed. 1H-NMR spectra show that the GSH-Hg(II)-hemoglobin complex also forms in simpler solutions containing HgCl2, GSH and hemoglobin, whereas the complex Hg(GSH)2 predominates in solutions of GSH and HgCl2. The lifetime of the GSH in the GSH-Hg(II)-hemoglobin complex is shown to be less than 30 s, which provides direct evidence for the first time that Hg(II) complexes in biological systems are quite labile, even though their thermodynamic stability is large. The effectiveness of eight sulfhydryl-containing ligands, some of which have been used as antidotes for Hg(II) poisoning, for releasing GSH from its Hg(II) complex in hemolyzed erythrocytes was also studied. Dithiol ligands were found to be more effective than monothiols, with dithioerythritol the most effective of the dithiols.
