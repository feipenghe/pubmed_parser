The Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), the most severe form of Acute Lung Injury (ALI), is a highly-fatal, diffuse non-cardiogenic edematous lung disorder. The pathogenesis of ARDS is unknown but lung inflammation and lung oxidative stress are likely contributing factors. Since no specific pharmacologic intervention exists for ARDS, our objective was to determine the effect of treatment with ergothioneine-a safe agent with multiple anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties on the development of lung injury and inflammation in rats insufflated with cytokines found in lung lavages of ARDS patients. Sprague-Dawley rats (3-10/group) were given 15 mg/kg or 150 mg/kg l-ergothioneine intravenously 1h before or 18 h after cytokine (IL-1 and IFNÎ³) insufflation. Lung injury (lavage LDH levels) and lung inflammation (lavage neutrophil numbers) were measured 24h after cytokine insufflation. Ergothioneine pre- and post-treatment generally decreased lung injury and lung inflammation in cytokine insufflated rats. Ergothioneine should be considered for additional testing as a potential therapy for treating and preventing ARDS.
