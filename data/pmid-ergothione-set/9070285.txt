The superoxide radical (O.2-) and nitric oxide (NO.) combine very rapidly to form peroxynitrite (ONOO-), a reactive tissue damaging nitrogen species thought to be involved in the pathology of several chronic diseases. The natural product ergothioneine protects against the nitration of tyrosine and the inactivation of alpha 1-antiproteinase by ONOO-. Ergothioneine merits further investigation as a biological and therapeutic antioxidant agent.
