Ergothioneine-rich crude extracts of Pleurotus cornucopiae were used as a source of antioxidative components to control the effects of lipid oxidation in astaxanthin-containing liposomes. This study aimed to elucidate the interactions of liposomal astaxanthin and lipids with ergothioneine-rich mushroom extract (ME) under radical oxidation-induced conditions to provide a better understanding of the agricultural and postharvest applications of this strategy. Azo compounds (2,2'-azobis(2-methylpropionamidine) dihydrochloride and 2,2'-azobis(2,4-dimethylvaleronitrile) were used as hydrophilic and lipophilic radical initiators, respectively. Results of this study demonstrate that the presence of ME significantly delayed the oxidative degradation of astaxanthin and controlled the progress of lipid oxidation in a liposomal system. The lipid hydroperoxide formation was significantly suppressed, while polyunsaturated fatty acids were protected from degradation. In addition, Crude ME also demonstrated more potent DPPH radical scavenging activities and EC50 than the equimolar concentrations of ergothioneine alone, which suggested the presence of additional compounds with antioxidative properties.
