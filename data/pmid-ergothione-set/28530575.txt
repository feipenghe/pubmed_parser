The effects of supplementing ergothioneine-rich mushroom extracts (ME) on discoloration and lipid oxidation in astaxanthin-pigmented salmon muscles were evaluated. ME (Flammulina velutipes) were added (in vitro) to minced Oncorhynchus mykiss muscles and stored at -10°C. During several weeks of storage, the ME-treated group showed lower lipid hydroperoxide (HPO) accumulation and higher retained astaxanthin levels than in the control group. The effects of adding concentrated ME (Pleurotus cornucopiae) to Oncorhynchus kisutch diets were also tested over a 2-month feeding trial. No adverse effects on fish growth or pigmentation were observed. Muscle samples were collected, stored (-2 or -18°C), and evaluated. At the end of the storage period, the ME-treated group had lower HPO and higher retained astaxanthin levels in the muscle samples than the levels in the control group. Thus, the addition of ergothioneine from MEs successfully controlled lipid oxidation and stabilized astaxanthin during post-harvest storage at low temperatures.
