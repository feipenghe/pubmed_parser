Spithioneines A and B (1 and 2), two new bohemamine-type pyrrolizidine alkaloids possessing an unusual ergothioneine moiety, were isolated from a marine-derived Streptomyces spinoverrucosus. Their structures were elucidated by spectroscopic analysis, CD spectra, and chemical degradation and synthesis. Compounds 1 and 2 are rare natural products that incorporate the amino acid ergothioneine.
