Unlike other bacteria, aerobic members of the order Actinomycetales show a close biochemical relationship to the fungi by their capacity to synthesize hercynine and ergothioneine. The myxomycete Physarum polycephalum, possessing the same synthetic ability, also shows this relationship. Contrariwise, the unusual position of yeasts as fungi is indicated by the inability of all yeastlike Ascomycetes and all except a few false yeasts to synthesize these two betaines.
