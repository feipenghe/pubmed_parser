A single reagent, containing cholesterol oxidase, cholesterol esterase, peroxidase, 4-hydroxybenzoate, and 4-aminophenazone, is used in determining serum cholesterol. Analysis time is 15 min, and the standard curve is linear to 6.0 g/liter. Analytical recovery of cholesterol was 100.1 +/- 0.4%. Within-run precision (CV) was less than or equal to 1.4 1.4%, between-run less than or equal to 4.8%. Comparison with results by a Liebermann Burchard method [Clin. Chim. Acta 5, 637 (1960)] gave a linear regression of y = 1.08x--0.05, with a correlation coefficient (r) of 0.985. Comparison with the Roeschlau enzymic method [J. Clin. Chem. Clin. Biochem, 12, 226 (1974)] gave y = 1.02x + 0.01 (r = 0.958). Comparison with the enzymic method of Allain et al. [Clin. Chem. 20, 470 (1974)] gave y = 1.01x--0.00 (r = 0.995). The following substances do not interfere up to the indicated concentrations (mg/liter): hemoglobin (5000), bilirubin (100), reduced glutathione (150), l-cysteine (400), urea (3000), creatinine (200), uric acid (200), d-glucose (10000), L-ascorbic acid (50), acetylsalicylic acid (500), L-DOPA (10), ergothioneine (1000), 2,5-dihydroxybenzoic acid (20), and 3,4-dihydroxybenzoic acid (10). Stored in an amber-colored bottle, the working reagent is stable for three months at 2--8 degrees C and for three weeks at 25 degrees C.
