Ergothioneine is a product of plant origin that accumulates in animal tissues. Its suggested ability to act as an antioxidant has been evaluated. Ergothioneine is a powerful scavenger of hydroxyl radicals (.OH) and an inhibitor of iron or copper ion-dependent generation of .OH from hydrogen peroxide (H2O2). It is also an inhibitor of copper ion-dependent oxidation of oxyhaemoglobin, and of arachidonic acid peroxidation promoted by mixtures of myoglobin (or haemoglobin) and H2O2. Ergothioneine is a powerful scavenger of hypochlorous acid, being able to protect alpha 1-antiproteinase against inactivation by this molecule. By contrast, it does not react rapidly with superoxide (O2-) or hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) and it does not inhibit microsomal lipid peroxidation in the presence of iron ions. Overall, our results show that ergothioneine at the concentrations present in vivo could act as an antioxidant.
