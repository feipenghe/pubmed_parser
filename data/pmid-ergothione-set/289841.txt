Successful unilateral extirpation of an inflamed seminal vesicle in a stallion led to systematic trials of the influence of a reduction and absence of the secretion of this gland upon semen characteristics. Operations were performed by the method described for the bull. The volume of ejaculates dropped and sperm concentration per ml increased in each of 2 stallions from which the seminal vesicles had been uni- or bi-laterally removed. Total sperm number and motility remained uninfluenced, but the percentage of eosin-stained spermatozoa increased in the unilaterally operated stallion and the percentage of abnormal spermatozoa increased significantly in both. Concentration of citric acid per ml and per ejaculate was significantly reduced after bilateral vesiculectomy. Ergothioneine concentration per ml increased in the unilaterally and in the bilaterally operated stallion.
