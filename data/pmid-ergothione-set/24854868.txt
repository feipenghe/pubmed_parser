The aim of this study was to evaluate the effects of ergothioneine and cysteamine as antioxidant supplements in a soybean lecithin extender for freezing ram semen. Twenty-four ejaculates were collected from four rams and diluted with extenders (1.5% soybean lecithin, 7% glycerol) containing no supplements (control) and cysteamine or ergothioneine (2, 4, 6 or 8mM). Motility by CASA, viability, plasma membrane functionality (HOS test), total abnormality, lipid peroxidation, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) activity and capacitation status (CTC staining) were assessed after thawing. Using 6mM of either antioxidant improved total motility. Cysteamine at 6mM and ergothioneine at 4 and 6mM improved viability and reduced lipid peroxidation (malondialdehyde concentration). Both antioxidants improved membrane functionality significantly, except at 8mM. Progressive motility, kinematic parameters, GPx activity, capacitation status and sperm abnormalities were not influenced by the antioxidant supplements. In conclusion, cysteamine at 6mM and ergothioneine at 4 or 6mM seem to improve the post-thawing quality of ram semen cryopreserved in a soybean lecithin extender.
