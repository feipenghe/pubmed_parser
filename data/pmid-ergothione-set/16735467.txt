It has been generally accepted, primarily from studies on methionine sulfoxide reductase (Msr) A, that the biological reducing agent for the members of the Msr family is reduced thioredoxin (Trx), although high levels of DTT can be used as the reductant in vitro. Preliminary experiments using both human recombinant MsrB2 (hMsrB2) and MsrB3 (hMsrB3) showed that although DTT can function in vitro as the reducing agent, Trx works very poorly, prompting a more careful comparison of the ability of DTT and Trx to function as reducing agents with the various members of the Msr family. Escherichia coli MsrA and MsrB and bovine MsrA efficiently use either Trx or DTT as reducing agents. In contrast, hMsrB2 and hMsrB3 show <10% of the activity with Trx as compared with DTT, raising the possibility that, in animal cells, Trx may not be the direct hydrogen donor or that there may be a Trx-independent reducing system required for MsrB2 and MsrB3 activity. A heat-stable protein has been detected in bovine liver that, in the presence of EDTA, can support the Msr reaction in the absence of either Trx or DTT. This protein has been identified as a zinc-containing metallothionein (Zn-MT). The results indicate that thionein (T), which is formed when the zinc is removed from Zn-MT, can function as a reducing system for the Msr proteins because of its high content of cysteine residues and that Trx can reduce oxidized T.
