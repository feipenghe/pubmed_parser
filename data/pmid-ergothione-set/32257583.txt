Ergothioneine is a thiohistidine derivative with potential benefits on many aging-related diseases. The central step of aerobic ergothioneine biosynthesis is the oxidative C-S bond formation reaction catalyzed by mononuclear nonheme iron sulfoxide synthases (EgtB and Egt1). Thus far, only the Mycobacterium thermoresistibile EgtB (EgtB 
                         ) crystal structure is available, while the structural information for the more industrially attractive Egt1 enzyme is not. Herein, we reported the crystal structure of the ergothioneine sulfoxide synthase (EgtB 
                         ) from Candidatus Chloracidobacterium thermophilum. EgtB 
                         has both EgtB- and Egt1-type of activities. Guided by the structural information, we conducted Rosetta Enzyme Design calculations, and we biochemically demonstrated that EgtB 
                         can be engineered more toward Egt1-type of activity. This study provides information regarding the factors governing the substrate selectivity in Egt1- and EgtB-catalysis and lays the groundwork for future sulfoxide synthase engineering toward the development of an effective ergothioneine process through a synthetic biology approach.
