The role of molecular crowding and viscosity on the apparent translational diffusion coefficient (ADC) of small metabolites was investigated in different subcellular organelles using the pulse-field gradient spin-echo 1H NMR technique. ADCs of metabolites with increasing radius of gyration (0.7 A < RG < 4.5 A) were measured in the cytoplasm of rat or chicken erythrocytes, in the nucleus of chicken erythrocytes, and in isolated rat liver mitochondria. Metabolite ADCs in these systems were compared with the corresponding ADCs determined in model solutions of increasing bulk viscosity but different molecular crowding. For solutions having the same viscosity, metabolite ADCs decreased with increasing concentration of cosolutes. This effect is adequately described by the modified Stokes-Einstein relationship, ADC = k/RG (1 + 2.5Phi), where k is a constant for a given temperature and Phi is an obstruction factor reporting the fractional volume of solution occupied by cosolutes, a measure of the molecular crowding in the solution. Cytoplasmic values of Phi for metabolites of different sizes did not depend exclusively on metabolite RG but on additional factors including the chemical nature of the metabolite, the presence of diffusional barriers, and metabolite-specific binding sites. In the case of water, nuclear Phi values approached those of the extracellular space while mitochondrial Phi values were significantly higher than those of the cytoplasm. Taken together, these results reveal important differences in molecular crowding within the different subcellular compartments, suggesting considerable diffusional heterogeneity for small metabolites within the different intracellular organelles.
