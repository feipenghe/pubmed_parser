: Inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) has stimulated much interest due to its surging incidences and health impacts in the U.S. and worldwide. However, the exact cause of IBD remains incompletely understood, and biomarker is lacking towards early diagnostics and effective therapy assessment. To tackle these, the emerging high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS)-based metabolomics shows promise. Here, we conducted a pilot untargeted LC/MS metabolomic profiling in Crohn's disease, for which serum samples of both active and inactive cases were collected, extracted, and profiled by a state-of-the-art compound identification workflow. Results show a distinct metabolic profile of Crohn's from control, with most metabolites downregulated. The identified compounds are structurally diverse, pointing to important pathway perturbations ranging from energy metabolism (e.g., Î²-oxidation of fatty acids) to signaling cascades of lipids (e.g., DHA) and amino acid (e.g., L-tryptophan). Importantly, an integral role of gut microbiota in the pathogenesis of Crohn's disease is highlighted. Xenobiotics and their biotransformants were widely detected, calling for massive exposomic profiling for future cohort studies as such. This study endorses the analytical capacity of untargeted metabolomics for biomarker development, cohort stratification, and mechanistic interpretation; the findings might be valuable for advancing biomarker research and etiologic inquiry in IBD.
