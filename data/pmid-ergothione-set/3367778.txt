Human erythrocytes were subjected to oxidative stress using arsenicals. The study is a model for thiol-related redox processes observed in the etiology of diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis. Spin-echo NMR spectroscopy of the living cell was used to monitor the cellular biochemistry. Oxidation of glutathione and the first demonstrated response of ergothioneine to a chemical stimulus in a cell were observed. The reversible nature of the ergothioneine response is interpreted as an environmental rather than a chemical change.
