Pleurotus citrinopileatus mycelium was prepared with high ergothioneine (Hi-Ergo) content and its proximate composition, nonvolatile taste components, and antioxidant properties were studied. The ergothioneine contents of fruiting bodies and Hi-Ergo and regular mycelia were 3.89, 14.57, and 0.37 mg/g dry weight, respectively. Hi-Ergo mycelium contained more dietary fiber, soluble polysaccharides, and ash but less carbohydrates, reducing sugar, fiber, and fat than regular mycelium. However, Hi-Ergo mycelium contained the smallest amounts of total sugars and polyols (47.43 mg/g dry weight). In addition, Hi-Ergo mycelium showed the most intense umami taste. On the basis of the half-maximal effective concentration values obtained, the 70% ethanolic extract from Hi-Ergo mycelium showed the most effective antioxidant activity, reducing power, and scavenging ability, whereas the fruiting body showed the most effective antioxidant activity, chelating ability, and Trolox-equivalent antioxidant capacity. Overall, Hi-Ergo mycelium could be beneficially used as a food-flavoring material or as a nutritional supplement.
