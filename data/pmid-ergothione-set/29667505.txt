The polar and non-polar extracts from the authenticated wild mushroom Phylloporia ribis were separated by hydrophilic interaction liquid chromatography (HILIC) and by reverse phase (RP)-HPLC, respectively. A split valve separated the eluents into two fractions for free-radical scavenging analysis and for structural identification. Forty-six compounds showed scavenging activity of the stable-free radical 2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH). The structures of 8 antioxidants (inosine, caffeic acid, ergothioneine, p-hydroxybenzoic acid, adenosine, 3,4-dihydroxybenzaldehyde, apigenin, and naringenin) are characterized by Mass Spectrometer. Among them, ergothioneine was the most abundant (>65%) and most active antioxidant in P. ribis.
