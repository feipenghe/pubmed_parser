Genghof, Dorothy S. (Yeshiva University, New York, N.Y.), and Olga Van Damme. Biosynthesis of ergothioneine and hercynine by mycobacteria. J. Bacteriol. 87:852-862. 1964.-Ergothioneine and hercynine were found to be synthesized by a wide variety of mycobacteria grown in chemically defined media free from these compounds. The cultures examined included 53 recently isolated and laboratory strains of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, 26 "unclassified" mycobacteria (Runyon groups I to IV), and representatives of most other species in the genus. Purification and separation of the betaines was achieved by means of chromatography on two successive alumina columns. Photometric measurement of the diazotized effluents from the second column permitted amounts of each compound to be determined. Measurement of hercynine by this method was made possible for the first time by the development of a standard curve. The pathway of ergothioneine biosynthesis in mycobacteria, as judged by the use S(35)-sulfate and l-histidine-2-C(14) as tracers, appears similar to that found in Neurospora crassa and Claviceps purpurea, that is, from histidine to ergothioneine via hercynine. None of a small group of bacteria other than mycobacteria was found to produce ergothioneine. Two strains of group A streptococci and one of Escherichia coli produced hercyninelike material, as yet unidentified.
