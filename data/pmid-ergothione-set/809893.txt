The paper describes the relation of citric acid to other chemical and biological indices of the fertility of stallion sperm. A positive relation was found between citric acid and the density and motility of spermatozoa, to the concentration of ergothioneine, and hemolytic activity, and a negative relation to pH and to the polarographic activity of proteins. Attention is drawn to the important nutritional function of citric acid.
