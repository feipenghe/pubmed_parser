To establish a reliable and practical ergothioneine (ERG) supply, we employed fermentative ERG production using Aspergillus oryzae, a fungus used for food production. We heterologously overexpressed the egt-1 and -2 genes of Neurospora crassa in A. oryzae and succeeded in producing ERG (231.0Â mg/kg of media, which was 20 times higher than the wild type). Abbreviations: ERG: ergothioneine; HER: hercynine; Cys-HER: hercynylcysteine-sulfoxide; SAM: S-adenosylmethionine; SAH: S-adenosylhomocysteine; l-His: l-histidine; l-Cys: l-cysteine; LC-ESI-MS: liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization-mass spectrometry.
