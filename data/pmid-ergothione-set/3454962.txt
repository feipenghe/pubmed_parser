Physiological processes connected with sexual maturation of stallions were observed on 10 half-breed Anglo-Arab stallions beginning from 8 months of age, until 4.5 years of age. It was found that there is full somatic and sexual development in the stallion reached around the age of 3.5 years, and the sperm morphology stabilized in the range of the physiological norm around 3.0 years of age. On the other hand biochemical components of the semen plasma such as glycerylphosphorylcholine (GPC), ergothioneine (EGT), total protein (PRT), up to age 4.5 years, reach significantly lower value than in mature stallions. This corresponds with lower freezability of stallion spermatozoa, up to this age.
