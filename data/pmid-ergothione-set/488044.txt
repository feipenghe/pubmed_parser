Circulating cadmium-thionein (Cd-MT) is cleared from the mammalian circulatory system by filtration through the kidney glomerulus with subsequent reabsorption by kidney proximal tubules. Damage to the tubules results following uptake of Cd-MT, which is dependent upon time and the dose level of cadmium administered. Intravenous administration of 109Cd-MT at doses of 0.017 and 0.17 mg Cd/kg body weight with examination of total renal uptake of 109Cd at 0.5, 3, and 24 hr disclosed that the rate of clearance from the blood and uptake by the kidney was significantly more rapid at the 0.017 mg Cd/kg dose. Ultrastructural changes resulting from intravenous injection of either form A or B of Cd-MT were characterized by increased numbers of pinocytotic vesicles and small, dense lysosomal structures. There was no evidence of mitochondrial swelling or cell death at either 3 or 6 hr after injection. The subcellular distribution of cadmium in kidney tissue at various times after administration of Cd-MT was determined by using differential centrifugation techniques with 109Cd and in situ by using x-ray microanalysis. At 30 min after injection of Cd-MT, significant amounts of cadmium were present in lysosomal fractions indicating an interaction between the tubular lysosome system and Cd-MT prior to the onset of overt cellular toxicity. Results suggest that Cd-MT is reabsorbed and broken down by kidney tubule cells in a physiological manner with possible subsequent release of the toxic cadmium ion.
