The reactivity of the endogenous antioxidants ascorbate, ergothioneine, and urate toward the high oxidation state of sperm whale myoglobin, ferrylmyoglobin-formed upon oxidation of metmyoglobin by H2O2--was evaluated by optical spectroscopy and SDS-PAGE analysis. Depending on whether these antioxidants were present in the reaction mixture before or after the addition of H2O2 to a metmyoglobin suspension, two different effects were observed: (a) In the former instances, ascorbate, ergothioneine, and urate reduced efficiently the oxoferryl moiety in ferrylmyoglobin to metmyoglobin and prevented dimer formation, a process which requires intermolecular cross-link involving specific tyrosyl residues. In addition, all the reducing compounds inhibited--albeit with different efficiencies--dityorosine-dependent fluorescence build up produced via dimerization of photogenerated tyrosyl radicals. (b) In the latter instances, the antioxidants reduced the preformed sperm whale ferrylmyoglobin to a modified metmyoglobin, the spectral profile of which was characterized by a blue shift of the typical 633 nm absorbance of native metmyoglobin. In addition, under these experimental conditions, the antioxidants did not affect dimer formation, thus indicating the irreversible character of the process. The dimeric form of sperm whale myoglobin--separated from the monomeric form by gel electrophoresis of a solution in which ergothioneine was added to preformed ferrylmyoglobin--revealed optical spectral properties in the visible region identical to that of the modified myoglobin. This suggests that the dimeric form of the hemoprotein is redox active, inasmuch as the oxoferryl complex can be reduced to its ferric form. These results are discussed in terms of the potential reactivity of these endogenous antioxidants toward the reducible loci of ferrylmyoglobin, the oxoferryl moiety, and the apoprotein radical.
