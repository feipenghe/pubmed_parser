In experiments designed to determine which active oxygen species contribute to hydrogen peroxide (HP)-induced reversion in strain TA104 of Salmonella typhimurium, 1,10-phenanthroline (an iron chelator, which prevents the formation of hydroxyl radicals from HP and DNA-bound iron by the Fenton reaction), sodium azide (a singlet oxygen scavenger), and potassium iodide (an hydroxyl radical scavenger) inhibited HP-induced reversion. These results indicate that hydroxyl radicals generated from HP by the Fenton reaction, and perhaps singlet oxygen, contribute to HP-induced reversion in TA104. However, reduced glutathione (reduces Fe3+ to Fe2+ and/or HP to water), diethyldithiocarbamic acid (an inhibitor of superoxide dismutase), diethyl maleate (a glutathione scavenger), and 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (an inhibitor of catalase) did not inhibit HP-induced reversion in TA104. Thus, superoxide radical anions and HP itself do not appear to be the cause of HP-induced reversion in this strain. In experiments on the effect of 5 common dietary compounds (beta-carotene, retinoic acid, and vitamins A, C and E), chlorophyllin (CHL), and ergothioneine, the frequency of revertants in TA104 increased above the spontaneous frequency in the presence of beta-carotene or vitamin C (about 2-fold) or vitamin A (about 3-fold). The 5 dietary antimutagens and CHL did not inhibit HP-induced reversion in TA104. However, L-ergothioneine inhibited HP-induced reversion in this strain. Therefore, it is likely that L-ergothioneine is a scavenger of hydroxyl radicals or an inhibitor of their formation, and perhaps of singlet oxygen, at the concentrations tested in TA104.
