Ergothioneine is a natural 2-thiol-amidazole amino acid that plays an important role in inflammation, depression, and cardiovascular disease. Flammulina velutipes is a common basidiomycete mushroom rich in ergothioneine (EGT). However, the biosynthetic pathway of EGT in F. velutipes is still unclear. In this study, the F. velutipes ergothioneine biosynthetic gene 1 (Fvegtl), F. velutipes ergothioneine biosynthetic gene 2 (Fvegt2), and F. velutipes ergothioneine biosynthetic gene 3 (Fvegt3) were cloned and expressed, and the activities of the proteins encoded by these three genes (FvEgt1, F. velutipes ergothioneine biosynthase 1; FvEgt2, F. velutipes ergothioneine biosynthase 2; and FvEgt3, F. velutipes ergothioneine biosynthase 3) were identified. The results showed that FvEgtl not only has the function of methyltransferase, but also has the function of hercynlcysteineteine sulfoxide (Hersul) synthase, which can catalyze the production of Hersul from histidine and cysteine in F. velutipes. FvEgt2 and FvEgt3 are two functionally different cysteine desulfurase enzymes. Among them, FvEgt2 is a cysteine-cysteine desulfurase-which catalyzes the activation of the S-H bond on cysteine, while FvEgt3 is a pyridoxal phosphate (PLP)-dependent cysteine desulfurase responsible for catalyzing the production of ketimine complex. Our results show that FvEgt1/FvEgt2/FvEgt3 can simultaneously catalyze the production of EGT by histidine, cysteine, and pyridoxal phosphate. Collectively, the in vitro synthesis of EGT in the edible fungus F. velutipes was first achieved, which laid the foundation for the biological production of EGT.
