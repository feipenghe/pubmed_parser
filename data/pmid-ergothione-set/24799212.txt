The combined effects of gum arabic coating (GA) and ergothioneine (ER) treatment on the sensory and physicochemical characteristics of red sea bream (Pagrosomus major) stored at 4 ± 1 °C for 16 days were investigated. Fish proximate composition, pH value, total volatile basic nitrogen (TVB-N), thiobarbituric acid (TBA), K-value, TCA-soluble peptides, colour, texture profile analyses (TPA), microbiological properties and sensory quality were measured. The results indicate that treatment with gum arabic and ergothioneine (GAER) retarded nucleotide breakdown, lipid oxidation, protein degradation, and reduced microbial growth compare with the control. The efficiency was better than that of GA or ER treatment. Sensory evaluation proved the efficacy of GAER coating by maintaining the overall quality of red sea bream during the storage period. Furthermore, GAER maintained better colour and textural characteristics. Our study suggests that GAER treatment has potential to improve the quality of red sea bream and extend its storage life.
